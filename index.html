								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p> I am a second-generation Filipina-American from Concord, California, with a multi-ethnic heritage that blends Filipino roots from Puerto Princesa, Palawan, with Hispanic and white settler ancestry. This diverse background deeply informs my perspective and commitment to equity and representation in astrophysics. As a dedicated advocate for women of color in science, I actively mentor emerging scholars and strive to lead by example through both my research and community engagement.

My academic journey spans three countries, complemented by nearly a year of data science experience. I worked as a data science intern at NASA Ames in 2019 and later as a physicist at Facebook (Meta) in 2021. Beyond astrophysics, I find balance through coffee, solo travel, and vinyasa yoga.

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								<p> The publications I've been a part of can be found <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4064-7883">here</a>.
									I am passionate about research between infrared and radio wavelengths and bridging the divide between theory and instrumentation. Although my
									research experiences have been diverse, I have unified my work through both high performance computing and data science applications. <br>
								</p>
								<h2 class="major">High-z Theory</h2>
								<p>I work broadly on simulating the high-z universe (z &ge; 6) to compare to current and future observations.
								<br> </p>
								<h3 class="major">Simulation-Based Inference for JWST Biases</h3>
								<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a new era of early universe quasar observations with
								the detection of stellar light from their hosts for the first time. I compare JWST high-z quasar host detections to analog galaxies within the <a href="http://bluetides-project.org/">BlueTides simulation</a>. 
									I create mock images and spectra of BlueTides galaxies to compare to hosts and help constrain observational biases. My latest project develops a simulation based inference pipeline to infer the observational bias on the stellar mass of the host galaxies of high-z quasars.
									See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08914">Berger+2024</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12130">Berger+2025</a>.

 -->
								<h3 class="major">Reionization</h3>
								<p>I apply Bayesian statistics and deep learning to future measurements of the universe during reionization
								to reconstruct the matter density field. The first paper on this work represents the first proof of concept for field level inference using only Bayesian methods of 21-cm fields at high-z. Through the use of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), we
									successfully reconstruct the matter density field during reionization using a brightness temperature measurement. This requires
									the use of highly optimized auto-differentiation methods on GPUs (I use <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/"> JAX </a>). Supervised by <a href="https://adeliegorce.github.io/">AdÃ©lie Gorce </a> and <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/"> Adrian Liu </a>.<br></p>
						
								<h3 class="major">Radio Instrumentation</h3>
								<p>
								During my master's degree at McGill University, I worked on calibrating
								radio telescopes using both traditional and novel techniques with <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~sievers/"> Jonathan Sievers</a>. I made the first proof of concept measurement using GPS satellites to calibrate radio dish telescopes. I measured
									consistent and repeatable satellite slices through the pathfinder of Canada's next leading radio telescope:  <a href="https://www.chord-observatory.ca/instrument">Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio transient Detector (CHORD)</a>. I also explored the use of GNSS in VLBI phase calibration in comparison to classic pulsar calibrators.

								I started my teaching journey as a community college student, tutoring introductory astronomy courses. Working with students from diverse backgroundsâ€”including English language learners and those with special needsâ€”taught me the importance of adaptability and empathy in education. This experience ignited my passion for teaching and drove me to become a more effective and compassionate instructor. Having had limited opportunities to experience active learning in my own educationâ€”despite knowing its effectiveness (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1821936116" target="_blank">see this article if you're interested</a>)â€”I strive to incorporate active learning into all my teaching experiences.

								Every other week, we synthesize two astrobites from across the spectrum of astrophysics subfields and unify them into a fun and cohesive theme. We also host episodes on topics related to equity and inclusion within astronomy. As of January, 2025, our episodes have amassed more than 27,000 downloads. Below are three of the episodes I'm most proud of. In Episode 68, I give an overview of my atypical path into astronomy.

								<h2 class="major">More outreach!</h2>

								<h3 class="major">Outreach beginnings</h3>
								I began participating in astronomy related public engagement as soon as I chose my major.
									My first experience was as a volunteer at the local <a href="https://chabotspace.org">Chabot Space and Science Center</a>
									near me in 2013. Since then, my passion for participating in public engagement went into full force. I became an
									<a href="https://aas.org/education/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program"> American Astronomical Society (AAS) Astronomy Ambassador </a>
									while at UC Berkeley, which included a two-day workshop on best practices in science public engagement. <br> <br>
								<h3 class="major">McGill Physics Hackathon and Outreach Coordinator</h3>
								I served as a McGill
									Physics Matters Outreach Coordinator throughout 2020. While in this role, I co-led the organization of the
									<a href="https://reporter.mcgill.ca/record-numbers-connect-learn-and-have-fun-at-mcgill-physics-hackathon/">McGill Physics Hackathon in November,
										2020</a> which included organizing eight coding workshops on Python to Machine Learning attended by more than 200 people. I also
									helped organize and facilitate a variety of programs and public astronomy talks supporting outreach in the Montreal community and beyond.
									This included initiating an ongoing international collaboration with the McGill Space Institute and
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT00j0sEttQ"> Dyer Observatory at Vanderbilt University </a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br> <br>
									<h3 class="major">Outreach in Underserved Communities</h3>
									As I participated more in outreach, I found that my main interest lies in reaching those who have not had as much access to science engagement programs. I strive to target my public engagement almost entirely to underserved communities. Through the Astronomy of the Pacific's <a href="https://astrosociety.org/education-outreach/k-12-science-teachers/project-astro.html">Project ASTRO </a>  Teacher Program (September 2016 - June 2017), I developed curriculum and instructed a fifth-grade class in astronomy at Rosa Parks Elementary School in Richmond, California. Since then, I also participated in a month long active learning and feedback workshop through the AAS and Astronomical Society of the Pacific that culminated in a presentation to Fischer Middle School students in San Jose, California in 2021.

<!--								<h2 class="major">Mentorship</h2>-->
<!--								(Good) mentorship has been the most important key to me continuing in my career in academia. I take mentorship very seriously and have mentored underrepresented students through their undergraduate degrees in physics at UC Berkeley, Dartmouth University, University of Melbourne, and McGill University through formal programs. I believe mentorship is the most important way to help students of all backgrounds succeed and an underdeveloped part of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI/DEI) efforts.
